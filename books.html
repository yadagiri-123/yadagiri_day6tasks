        <h2 id="1">CHAPTER 1:Ancient India</h2>
        <p>India is a country in South Asia whose name comes from the Indus River. The name 'Bharata' is used as a designation for the country in their constitution referencing the ancient mythological emperor, Bharata, whose story is told, in part, in the Indian epic Mahabharata.

            According to the writings known as the Puranas (religious/historical texts written down in the 5th century CE), Bharata conquered the whole subcontinent of India and ruled the land in peace and harmony. The land was, therefore, known as Bharatavarsha (`the subcontinent of Bharata'). Hominid activity in the Indian subcontinent stretches back over 250,000 years, and it is, therefore, one of the oldest inhabited regions on the planet.

        <h2 id="2">CHAPTER 2:Mauryan Art</h2>
        <p>The Maurya Empire (Ashokan Prakrit: ëÄ´ëÄ∏ëÄïëÄ•ëÅÇ, MƒÅgadhe[21]) was a geographically extensive Iron Age historical power in South Asia based in Magadha. Founded by Chandragupta Maurya in 322 BCE, it existed in loose-knit fashion until 185 BCE.[22] The empire was centralized by the conquest of the Indo-Gangetic Plain; its capital city was located at Pataliputra (modern Patna). Outside this imperial centre, the empire's geographical extent was dependent on the loyalty of military commanders who controlled the armed cities scattered within it.[23][24][25] During Ashoka's rule (ca. 268‚Äì232 BCE), the empire briefly controlled the major urban hubs and arteries of the Indian subcontinent excepting the deep south.[22] It declined for about 50 years after Ashoka's rule, and dissolved in 185 BCE with the assassination of Brihadratha by Pushyamitra Shunga and foundation of the Shunga dynasty in Magadha.

            Chandragupta Maurya raised an army, with the assistance of Chanakya, author of the Arthashastra,[26] and overthrew the Nanda Empire in c.‚Äâ322 BCE. Chandragupta rapidly expanded his power westwards across central and western India by conquering the satraps left by Alexander the Great, and by 317 BCE the empire had fully occupied northwestern India.[27] The Mauryan Empire then defeated Seleucus I, a diadochus and founder of the Seleucid Empire, during the Seleucid‚ÄìMauryan war, thus acquiring territory west of the Indus River.[28][29]</p>
        <h2 id="3">CHAPTER 3:Gupta Era</h2>
        <p>The Gupta Empire was an ancient Indian empire which existed from the early 4th century CE to early 6th century CE. At its zenith, from approximately 319 to 467 CE, it covered much of the Indian subcontinent.[6] This period has been considered as the Golden Age of India by some historians,[7] although this characterisation has been disputed by other historians.[note 1][note 2][10] The ruling dynasty of the empire was founded by Gupta, and the most notable rulers of the dynasty were Chandragupta I, Samudragupta, Chandragupta II and Skandagupta. The 5th-century CE Sanskrit poet Kalidasa credits the Guptas with having conquered about twenty-one kingdoms, both in and outside India, including the kingdoms of Parasikas, the Hunas, the Kambojas, tribes located in the west and east Oxus valleys, the Kinnaras, Kiratas, and others.[11][12][13]</p>
        <h2 id="4">CHAPTER 4:Jainism</h2>
        <p>Jainism (/Ààd íe…™n…™z…ôm/ JAY-niz-…ôm), also known as Jain Dharma, is an Indian religion. Jainism traces its spiritual ideas and history through the succession of twenty-four tirthankaras (supreme preachers of Dharma), with the first in the current time cycle being Rishabhadeva, whom the tradition holds to have lived millions of years ago, the twenty-third tirthankara Parshvanatha, whom historians date to the 9th century BCE, and the twenty-fourth tirthankara Mahavira, around 600 BCE. Jainism is considered an eternal dharma with the tirthankaras guiding every time cycle of the cosmology. The three main pillars of Jainism are ahi·πÉsƒÅ (non-violence), anekƒÅntavƒÅda (non-absolutism), and aparigraha (asceticism).</p>
        <h2 id="5">CHAPTER 5:Buddhism</h2>
        <p>Buddhism (/Ààb äd…™z…ôm/ BUUD-ih-z…ôm, US also /ÀàbuÀêd-/ BOOD-),[1][2][3] also known as Buddha Dharma[a][b] and Dharmavinaya (transl.‚Äâ"doctrines [and] disciplines"),[c] is an Indian religion[d] and philosophical tradition based on teachings attributed to the Buddha.[4] It is the world's fourth-largest religion,[5][6] with over 520 million followers, known as Buddhists, who comprise seven percent of the global population.[7][8] Buddhism originated in the eastern Gangetic plain as a ≈õrama·πáa‚Äìmovement in the 5th century BCE, and gradually spread throughout much of Asia via the Silk Road.</p>
        <h2 id="6">CHAPTER 6:Vijayanagara Emphire</h2>
        <p>The Vijayanagara Empire (/v…™Àåd í…ôj…ôÀàn…ëÀê…°…ôr…ô/; also called the Karnata Kingdom[5]) was a medieval Hindu empire that covered much of the region of Southern India, ruling the lands of the modern states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Goa, and some parts of Telangana, Maharashtra and some parts of Sri Lanka. It was established in 1336 by the brothers Harihara I and Bukka Raya I of the Sangama dynasty, members of a pastoralist cowherd community that claimed Yadava lineage.[6][7][note 1] The empire rose to prominence as a culmination of attempts by the southern powers to ward off Turco-Persian Muslim invasions by the end of the 13th century. At its peak, it conquered almost all of Southern India's ruling dynasties and pushed the Turco-Persian sultans of the Deccan beyond the Tungabhadra-Krishna River doab region, in addition to annexing Gajapati Empire (Odisha) up to the Krishna River, thus becoming a notable power.[8]</p>
        <h2 id="7">CHAPTER 7:Harshavardhana</h2>
        <p>The Vijayanagara Empire (/v…™Àåd í…ôj…ôÀàn…ëÀê…°…ôr…ô/; also called the Karnata Kingdom[5]) was a medieval Hindu empire that covered much of the region of Southern India, ruling the lands of the modern states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Goa, and some parts of Telangana, Maharashtra and some parts of Sri Lanka.

        <h2 id="8">CHAPTER 8:Indian National Movement</h2>
        <p>The Indian independence movement was a series of historic events with the ultimate aim of ending British rule in India also known as British Raj. It lasted until 1947.

            The first nationalistic revolutionary movement for Indian independence emerged from Bengal. It later took root in the newly formed Indian National Congress with prominent moderate leaders seeking the right to appear for Indian Civil Service examinations in British India, as well as more economic rights for natives. The first half of the 20th century saw a more radical approach towards self-rule.
            
            The stages of the independence struggle in the 1920s were characterized by the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi and Congress' adoption of Gandhi's policy of non-violence and civil disobedience. Some of the leading followers of Gandhi's ideology were Jawaharlal Nehru, Vallabhbhai Patel, Abdul Ghaffar Khan, Maulana Azad, and others. Intellectuals such as Rabindranath Tagore, Subramania Bharati, and Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay spread patriotic awareness. Female leaders like Sarojini Naidu, Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit, Pritilata Waddedar, and Kasturba Gandhi promoted the emancipation of Indian women and their participation in the freedom struggle.</p>
        <h2 id="9">CHAPTER 9:1857 Revoult</h2>
        <p>The Indian Rebellion of 1857 was a major uprising in India in 1857‚Äì58 against the rule of the British East India Company, which functioned as a sovereign power on behalf of the British Crown.[4][5] The rebellion began on 10 May 1857 in the form of a mutiny of sepoys of the company's army in the garrison town of Meerut, 40 mi (64 km) northeast of Delhi. It then erupted into other mutinies and civilian rebellions chiefly in the upper Gangetic plain and central India,[b][6][c][7] though incidents of revolt also occurred farther north and east.[d][8] The rebellion posed a military threat to British power in that region,[e][9] and was contained only with the rebels' defeat in Gwalior on 20 June 1858.[10] On 1 November 1858, the British granted amnesty to all rebels not involved in murder, though they did not declare the hostilities to have formally ended until 8 July 1859.</p>
        <h2 id="10">CHAPTER 10:Dandi Satyagraha</h2>
        <p>The Salt march, also known as the Salt Satyagraha, Dandi March, and the Dandi Satyagraha, was an act of nonviolent civil disobedience in colonial India, led by Mahatma Gandhi. The 24-day march lasted from 12 March 1930 to 5 April 1930 as a direct action campaign of tax resistance and nonviolent protest against the British salt monopoly. Another reason for this march was that the Civil Disobedience Movement needed a strong inauguration that would inspire more people to follow Gandhi's example. Gandhi started this march with 78 of his trusted volunteers. The march spanned 387 kilometres (240 mi), from Sabarmati Ashram to Dandi, which was called Navsari at that time (now in the state of Gujarat).[1] Growing numbers of Indians joined them along the way. When Gandhi broke the British Raj salt laws at 8:30 am on 6 April 1930, it sparked large-scale acts of civil disobedience against the salt laws by millions of Indians.[2]</p>
        <h2 id="11">CHAPTER 11:Quit India</h2>
        <p>The Quit India Movement was a movement launched at the Bombay session of the All India Congress Committee by Mahatma Gandhi on 8 August 1942, during World War II, demanding an end to British rule in India.

            After the British failed to secure Indian support for the British war effort with Cripps Mission, Gandhi made a call to Do or Die in his Quit India speech delivered in Bombay on 8 August 1942 at the Gowalia Tank Maidan. Viceroy Linlithgow remarked the movement to be "by far the most serious rebellion since 1857".[5][6]
            
            The All India Congress Committee launched a mass protest demanding what Gandhi called "An Orderly British Withdrawal" from India. Even though it was at war, Britain was prepared to act. Almost the entire leadership of the Indian National Congress was imprisoned without trial within hours of Gandhi's speech. Most spent the rest of the war in prison and out of contact with the masses. The British had the support of the Viceroy's Council, of the All India Muslim League, the Hindu Mahasabha, the princely states, the Indian Imperial Police, the British Indian Army, and the Indian Civil Service. Many Indian businessmen profiting from heavy wartime spending did not support the Quit India Movement. The major outside support came from the Americans, as President Franklin D. Roosevelt pressured Prime Minister Winston Churchill to give in to some of the Indian demands.[7]</p>
